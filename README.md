# iocore

iocore provides the basic abstractions required to build a professional C++ systems application. It also provides a build framework using CMake, a test framework using gtest and basic IO abstractions like TCP, AIO.

This library is designed to abstract the fundamental components of a typical systems application from the scheduler and applicaiton logic.
